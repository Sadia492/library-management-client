# üìö Minimal Library Management System

A clean, client-side Library Management System built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit Query**, and **TypeScript**. This minimalist system allows users to view, manage, and borrow books without authentication or payment integration, focusing purely on functionality and state management.

**Goals:**

- Implement full CRUD functionality for books.
